# HadoopMR
A school project I did that uses process WARC format files and counts the emails on each domain.

To run this program, you would need to install Hadoop, set the class path to archive.jar (From https://github.com/Smerity/cc-warc-examples/tree/master/lib), and place the src folder in the Hadoop folder.
